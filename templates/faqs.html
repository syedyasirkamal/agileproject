                    <p>You need to take your 36 classes in a maximum period of 3 months. Time will start running after you take the first class.
                    Classes do not expire, but if you exceed the 3-month time limit, you will no longer be eligible for a refund. 
                    To improve your listening and comprehension of accents, you must take classes with at least 3 different teachers in your program.
                    To be eligible for a refund, you must take at least 6 classes with each teacher. For example, taking 1 class with teacher A, 1 class with teacher B and 34 classes with teacher C is not possible.
                    It is only acceptable 6 classes (at least) with teacher A, 6 with teacher B and 24 with teacher C. You choose your teachers for every lesson.
                    You have the right to reschedule 1 class per month maximum, and the maximum number of classes to take per day is 1.</p>
