 ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syedyasirkamal/agileproject/main/images/User%20Persona_Uriel%20Benitez_main.png)

### Product Backlog
> The complete Product Backlog is saved in the following Trello Link: https://trello.com/b/KLDzl54E/cuzy-kanban

### Product Backlog Items
> The Product Backlog includes 12 PBIs listed in the Trello Product Backlog link above.

### User Stories
> User Stories have been created for each PBI. They are included Product Backlog Items cards in the link above.

### Product Backlog Order
> The product backlog has been ordered. The rationale we used was two-fold: First, we considered the sequential development of the application from a technology perspective. Second, we took into account the value added of each specific PBI. For example, we had to register a web domain before we can actually start designing the website since the site needs to reference graphics and hyperlinks that will be based on/include the domain name. 

### Definiton of Ready 
> - We have a clear title for every PBI.
> - We have clear user stories.
> - We have added additional details for select user stories as necessary.
> - We have outlined acceptance criteria for each PBI.
> - Each PBI has been accurately estimated as per the methodology mentioned later. 

### Estimate PBIs
> All PBIs have been estimated and recorded in the Trello link above.

### Estimate PBIs in Relative Size Units
> All PBIs have been estimated in relative size units using the Fibonacci sequence scale.

### Whole Team Relative Size Estimating
> - We played Planning Poker to estimate story points for each product backlog item. 
> - The Scrum  Master (Uriel) facilitated the game and PBIs were estimated as story points using the Fibonacci sequence scale, with an upper limit of 8 story points. 
> - In addition, we used an Estimation Board with input from the whole team to move one of the items around to ensure better relativity. 

### Developers-Only Estimating
> Only the developers (Yasir and Zhao) took part in Planning Poker for estimation. 



# Project Part 2

### Forecast
> The Forecast for our first sprint is 6.5 Story Points (using the Fibonacci Scale).

### Rationale For Our Forecast
> The rationale for the forecast is as follows:
> - The Sprint has been timeboxed to 1 week (due to the time between Project Part 1 and Project Part 2).
> - There is 1 Senior Developer and 1 Junior Developer
> - Each developer communicated the amount of time they have available during the Sprint and estimated how much effort they would thereby be able to take on.
> - Our team took into account time we would need for Sprint Planning, Periodic Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and a Team Retrospective when determining how much time would be available for coding. 
> - Our team made sure that we took on work that would deliver a vertical slice of value to the stakeholder (student Spanish learner).

### Pull Stories Into Sprint Backlog
> Based on the forecase described above, the team has pulled User Stories from the Product Backlog into the the current Sprint Backlog. We pulled stories from the top of our Product Backlog. The aggregate size of the stories does not exceed our forecast. Only developers on our team participated in pulling stories from the Product Backlog into the Spring Backlog.

### Right Size User Stories
> Our forecasted velocity for this Sprint is 6.5 and the largest user story is estimated at 3 story points. Therefore the size of each sprint backlog item is less than half of our forecasted velocity for the Sprint. None of the PBIs were too large for the sprint so we did not need to split any of them. 

### Developer Tasks
> User stories have been decomposed into Developer Tasks. The Developer Tasks are listed as checklist items in the User Story Cards within Trello. The Trello Board can be found here: https://trello.com/b/KLDzl54E/cuzy-kanban This Trello board is publicly accessible and can be viewed by course staff.

### Kanban Board
> The Sprint Backlog, including both the User Stories and Developer Tasks, is represented in a Kanban Board. The link for the Kanban Board is: https://trello.com/b/KLDzl54E/cuzy-kanban. Course staff can view the Kanban Board.

### Daily Scrums
> Our team performed multiple Daily Scrums. Screenshot from one of our daily scrums below as evidence.
> 
> ![](https://github.com/syedyasirkamal/agileproject/blob/main/Sprint-1/images/Daily%20Scrum%20Evidence.png)

### Daily Scrums - Last 24 Hours
> During each of our Daily Scrums, the developers answered the question, "What did you do in the last 24 hours that helped you meet the Sprint Goal?" Below is a list of activities the developers shared during one of our Daily Scrums:
> - Yasir: Researched how to write test cases
> - Yasir: Researched email validation libaray
> - Zhao: Created wireframe of our product
> - Zhao: Researched a plug in for Figma to generate HTML and CSS code
> - Yasir and Zhao: Did pair programming
> - Christina and Uriel: Worked together to develop content for website and forms
> - Uriel and Yasir: Worked together to create custom graphics for promotions 

### Daily Scrums - Next 24 Hours 
> During each of our Daily Scrums, the developers answered the question, "What will you do in the next 24 hours to meet the Sprint Goal?" Below is a list of activities the developers shared during one of our Daily Scrums:
> - Yasir: Will figure out how to build the class for the Python testing
> - Yasir: Will identify two additional tests for the email validation
> - Zhao: Will generate HTML and CSS Code
> - Yasir: Will add promotional banners to the original ChidoLingo website
> - Zhao: Will edit wording on the new website based on feedback from Product Owner
> - Christina and Uriel: Will review the new website and provide editing feedback to the developers

### Daily Scrums - Impediments 
> During each of our Daily Scrums, the developers answered the question, "Do you see any impediment that prevents the Developers from meeting the Sprint Goal?" Below is a list of impediments the developers shared during one of our Daily Scrums as well as the corresponding impediment removal plan:
> - Yasir was not sure if we should use Python or PHP for our project. The plan to remove the impediment is to post a message to the professor on the course Discord Channel. 
> - Yasir was not sure if we could use a PHP email validation library. The plan to remove the impediment is to post a message to the professor on the course Discord Channel. 
> - Zhao is new to using HTML and CSS code and has technical questions about how to perform certain tasks. The plan to remove the impediment is for him to conduct research on his technical questions. If he cannot figure out the answers himself, he will schedule time with the Senior Developer (Yasir) to figure out the answers together.

### Burndown Chart - Updates 
> During each of our Daily Scrums, we updated the Burndown Chart. Below are two examples of the Burndown Chart being updated.

> 
> ![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/syedyasirkamal/agileproject/main/images/Sprint%20Review_11.11.22.jpeg)

### Sprint Retrospective
> - Our team conducted a Sprint Retrospective. 
> - One action that we identified that would make our team significantly better is to manage our team logistics better. In the previous sprint, we scheduled our meetings and Daily Scrums one by one. We will be able to manage our time and deliverables better if we plan out the days/times of all our Sprint meetings at the beginning of the Sprint.
> - Our action plan is articulated as a PBI, including User Acceptance Criteria.
> - This new PBI has been added to the top of the Product Backlog, ready to be pulled into the next Sprint.
> - A second observation is that one team member is not a registered student in the class and there are certain limitations in his involvement. The team will find ways to better utilize his skills on future aspects of this project.

### True User Stories
> All of the PBIs our Product Backlog, including the current Sprint Backlog, are True User Stories. They can be found here: https://trello.com/b/KLDzl54E/cuzy-kanban



# Project Part 3

### Forecast
> The Forecast for our second sprint is 16 Story Points (using the Fibonacci Scale).

### Rationale For Our Forecast
> The rationale for the forecast is as follows:
> - The Sprint has been timeboxed to 2 weeks.
> - There is 1 Senior Developer and 1 Junior Developer
> - Our first Sprint was 1 week and we did 8 points worth of effort (based on the revised Kanban board). 
> - Each developer communicated the amount of time they have available during the Sprint and estimated how much effort they would thereby be able to take on.
> - Our team took into account time we would need for Sprint Planning, Periodic Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and a Team Retrospective when determining how much time would be available for coding. 
> - Our team made sure that we took on work that would deliver a vertical slice of value to the stakeholders (student Spanish learners and the business partners).

### Pull Stories Into Sprint Backlog
> Based on the forecase described above, the team has pulled User Stories from the Product Backlog into the the current Sprint Backlog. We pulled stories from the top of our Product Backlog. The aggregate size of the stories does not exceed our forecast. Only developers on our team participated in pulling stories from the Product Backlog into the Spring Backlog.

### Right Size User Stories
> Our forecasted velocity for this Sprint is 16 and the largest user story is estimated at 8 story points. Therefore the size of each sprint backlog item is no more than half of our forecasted velocity for the Sprint. None of the PBIs were too large for the sprint so we did not need to split any of them. 

### Developer Tasks
> User stories have been decomposed into Developer Tasks. The Developer Tasks are listed as checklist items in the User Story Cards within Trello. The Trello Board can be found here: https://trello.com/b/KLDzl54E/cuzy-kanban. This Trello board is publicly accessible and can be viewed by course staff.

### Sprint Retrospective
> - Our team conducted a Sprint Retrospective on 11/27/22.
> - One action that we identified that would make our team significantly better is to articulate an MVP for our product. By articulating an MVP, our team will be able to focus its time and efforts on those features so that we don't waste time on work that it not as important or valuable.  
> - Our action plan is articulated as a PBI, including User Acceptance Criteria.
> - This new PBI has been added to the top of the Product Backlog, ready to be pulled into the next Sprint.

### True User Stories
> All of the PBIs in our Product Backlog, including the current Sprint Backlog, are True User Stories. They can be found here: https://trello.com/b/KLDzl54E/cuzy-kanban



# Project Part 4

### Forecast
> The Forecast for our second sprint is 20 Story Points (using the Fibonacci Scale).

### Rationale For Our Forecast
> The rationale for the forecast is as follows:
> - The Sprint has been timeboxed to 2 weeks.
> - There is 1 Senior Developer and 1 Junior Developer
> - Our third Sprint was 2 weeks and we did 17 points worth of effort. 
> - Our team has increased its velocity each sprint.
> - Each developer communicated the amount of time they have available during the Sprint and estimated how much effort they would thereby be able to take on.
> - Our team took into account time we would need for Sprint Planning, Periodic Daily Scrums, Sprint Review, and a Team Retrospective when determining how much time would be available for coding. 
> - Our team made sure that we took on work that would deliver a vertical slice of value to the stakeholders (student Spanish learners and the business partners).

### Right Size User Stories
> Our forecasted velocity for this Sprint is 20 and the largest user story is estimated at 8 story points. Therefore the size of each sprint backlog item is no more than half of our forecasted velocity for the Sprint. None of the PBIs were too large for the sprint so we did not need to split any of them. 

### Developer Tasks
