### Product Backlog
> The complete Product Backlog is saved in the following Trello Link: https://trello.com/b/KLDzl54E/cuzy-kanban

### Product Backlog Items
> The Product Backlog includes 12 PBIs listed in the Trello Product Backlog link above.

### User Stories
> User Stories have been created for each PBI. The are included Product Backlog Items cards in the link above.

### Product Backlog Order
> The product backlog has been ordered. The rationale we used was two-fold: First, we considered the sequential development of the application from a technology perspective. Second, we took into account the value added of each specific PBI. For example, we had to register a web domain before we can actually start designing the website since the site needs to reference graphics and hyperlinks that will be based on/include the domain name. 

### Definiton of Ready 
> We have a clear title for every PBI.
We have clear user stories.
We have added additional details for select user stories as necessary.
We have outlined acceptance criteria for each PBI.
Each PBI has been accurately estimated as per the methodology mentioned later. 

### Estimate PBIs
> All PBIs have been estimated and recorded in the Trello link above.

### Estimate PBIs in Relative Size Units
> All PBIs have been estimated in relative size units using the Fibonacci sequence scale.

### Whole Team Relative Size Estimating
> We played Planning Poker to estimate story points for each product backlog item. The Scrum  Master (Uriel) facilitated the game and PBIs were estimated as story points using the Fibonacci sequence scale, with an upper limit of 8 story points. In addition, we used an Estimation Board with input from the whole team to move one of the items around to ensure better relativity. 

### Developers-Only Estimating
> Only the developers (Yasir and Zhao) took part in Planning Poker for estimation.
